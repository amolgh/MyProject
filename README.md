College result ERP system

The college maintains the information, about the student details, student marks, exam details, department wise staff details etc.Also keep the contacts with student and staff manually. Each and every activity that belongs to college is maintained by paperwork.
In the existing system the whole work is done manually. All the information is recorded in register and MS Excel application. All student entries and student results process is very time consuming and error prone. It needs lots of paper work. When any student related data needed it is required to search in the records. Several functions like generate the results for details were given manually.
In the present system, the authority is required to collect the information about the students through manually communication.
